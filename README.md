# 🔐 PortSwigger Web Security Academy Write-ups

Welcome to my *PortSwigger Labs repository*.  
This repo documents my hands-on journey through the *PortSwigger Web Security Academy, from **beginner to advanced*.  
Each write-up includes *screenshots, methodology, exploitation steps, and remediation* to show not just how the attack works, but also how to defend against it.
