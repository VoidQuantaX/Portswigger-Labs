# Access Control â€“ Lab 1: Unprotected Admin Functionality

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab highlights a *broken access control* vulnerability where an administrative function was exposed without any authorization checks. Instead of enforcing proper access control, the application simply hid the sensitive endpoint.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

1. *Reconnaissance*
   - Inspected /robots.txt file.
   - Found a disallowed path: /administrator-panel.

2. *Exploitation*
   - Navigated directly to /administrator-panel.
   - Successfully accessed the admin interface without being an administrator.

3. *Privilege Escalation*
   - Executed an administrative action: deleted the user carlos.  
   - This confirmed the lack of authorization controls.

## ðŸ”¹ Proof of Exploit

(Screenshot shows successful access to the admin panel and deletion of the carlos account.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Impact
- Unauthorized users could access administrative functionality.  
- Potential consequences:
  - Mass deletion of accounts.  
  - Data manipulation.  
  - Full system takeover.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation
- Enforce *server-side role-based access control (RBAC)*.  
- Never expose sensitive endpoints in robots.txt.  
- Implement authorization middleware to validate user roles.  
- Monitor and log access attempts to restricted areas.

# Access Control â€“ Lab 2: Unprotected Admin Functionality (via HTML Source)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates a *broken access control* vulnerability where an administrative panel was hidden in the HTML source code but not protected with any authentication or authorization mechanism.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

1. *Reconnaissance*
   - Viewed the page source (Ctrl+U).
   - Found a hidden link pointing to /administrator-panel.

2. *Exploitation*
   - Accessed the hidden URL directly in the browser.
   - The admin panel loaded without requiring admin credentials.

3. *Privilege Escalation*
   - Deleted the user carlos via the exposed admin functionality.  
   - This confirmed that the application lacked proper access control.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Impact
- Unauthorized users could access administrative interfaces.  
- Potential consequences include:
  - Account deletions or modifications.  
  - Full takeover of user data and application functionality.  
  - Compromise of business-critical operations.  

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation
- Enforce *server-side authentication and authorization checks*.  
- Do not rely on obscurity (hiding links in HTML or JS).  
- Restrict access to admin routes via RBAC, strong authentication, and network controls.  
- Regularly review source code and remove hardcoded sensitive URLs.

# Access Control â€“ Lab 3: Parameter-Based Access Control

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates an insecure access control mechanism where user roles are determined by *parameters* (such as query strings, cookies, or hidden fields) that are directly modifiable by the client.  
By tampering with these parameters, an attacker can escalate privileges and gain administrative access.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

1. *Normal Login*
   - Logged in as a regular user.  
   - Observed a parameter in the request: admin=false.

2. *Tampering the Parameter*
   - Captured the request in Burp Suite Proxy while accessing the *Admin Panel*.  
   - Modified the parameter from admin=false â†’ admin=true.  
   - Successfully accessed the *admin interface*.

3. *Exploitation*
   - Performed an administrative action: deleted the user carlos.  
   - Lab solved âœ…

## ðŸ”¹ Proof of Exploit
![Parameter tampering to access admin panel](../images/access-control-lab3-solved.png)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Impact
- Any user can escalate privileges by altering request parameters.  
- Potential consequences:
  - Full admin account takeover.  
  - Ability to delete or modify user data.  
  - Compromise of the entire application.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation
- Never store authorization or role information in user-controllable parameters.  
- Implement *server-side role-based access control (RBAC)*.  
- Validate user roles on every sensitive action.  
- Use secure session handling instead of hidden fields or query strings.

# Access Control â€“ Lab 4: Horizontal Privilege Escalation (IDOR with GUIDs)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates an *Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)* / horizontal privilege escalation where a normal user can access another userâ€™s data by substituting identifiers (GUIDs) in requests. Even seemingly random GUIDs can be discovered elsewhere in the app (profiles, comments, links), allowing attackers to view or act on other usersâ€™ accounts.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology

1. *Reconnaissance*
   - Logged in as wiener:peter.  
   - Navigated to *My Account* and observed an account request containing my GUID (id=<my_GUID>).

2. *Discovery of Target GUID*
   - Browsed public pages (e.g., blog posts, comments) and found *Carlosâ€™ GUID* exposed in a link or request.

3. *Tampering the Request*
   - Captured the /my-account?id=<my_GUID> request in Burp Proxy.  
   - Replaced my GUID with Carlosâ€™ GUID and resent the request.

4. *Exploitation*
   - The server returned Carlosâ€™ account page data (API key, profile).  
   - Submitted Carlosâ€™ API key to the lab to complete the challenge.  
   - Lab solved âœ…

## ðŸ”¹ Proof of Exploit

(Screenshot showing Carlosâ€™ account page / API key returned after substituting GUID.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Impact
- Attackers can *read sensitive user data* (API keys, emails, personal info).  
- Attackers can *modify or delete other users' data* if write actions are exposed.  
- Compromise ranges from privacy breach to full account takeover and downstream escalation (API abuse, pivoting).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation
- Enforce *server-side object-level authorization*: always verify resource.owner == session.user.  
- Do not trust client-supplied IDs for authorization decisions.  
- Avoid exposing internal identifiers where possible; if required, validate ownership on every access.  
- Implement logging/alerts for suspicious cross-user access patterns.

# Access Control â€“ Lab 5: Horizontal â†’ Vertical Privilege Escalation

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates how a *horizontal privilege escalation (IDOR)* can be chained into a *vertical escalation* by exposing admin credentials or sensitive fields.  
An attacker who can view another userâ€™s page (via IDOR) may find admin-only data (e.g., a prefixed/hidden password) and then log in as the administrator to gain full control.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Vulnerability
The application identifies resources using a client-controllable parameter, for example:/my-account?id=wiener
By substituting another userâ€™s identifier (e.g., id=administrator), the application returns that userâ€™s page. If that page contains *sensitive data* (hidden fields, prefilled passwords, tokens), an attacker can extract those values and *assume the higher-privilege identity*.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology / Lab Walkthrough

1. *Initial Access (Recon)*  
   - Logged in as a normal user: wiener / peter.  
   - Navigated to *My Account* and observed the account request:  
     
     GET /my-account?id=wiener
     

2. *Horizontal IDOR*  
   - Captured the request in Burp Suite Proxy and replaced the id parameter with administrator:  
     
     GET /my-account?id=administrator
     
   - The server returned the administratorâ€™s account page.

3. *Discovery of Sensitive Data*  
   - Inspected the returned HTML source and found the admin password present in a hidden/prefilled field.

4. *Vertical Escalation (Account Takeover)*  
   - Copied the administrator password from the source.  
   - Logged out and re-authenticated as:  
     
     Username: administrator
     Password: <retrieved-password>
     
   - Successfully logged in as the administrator.

5. *Impactful Action (Proof of Compromise)*  
   - Accessed the Admin Panel and performed an administrative action: *deleted user carlos*.  
   - Lab solved âœ…

---

## ðŸ”¹ Security Impact
- Exposing sensitive fields (passwords, tokens) in user-accessible pages allows attackers to *escalate privileges* from normal users to administrators.  
- Consequences include complete application compromise, data loss, and unauthorized destructive actions.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation
- *Never* expose secrets in HTML (hidden fields, prefilled inputs, client-side JS).  
- Enforce *server-side authorization* for every resource and action: resource.owner == session.user.  
- Remove any sensitive values from client responses. Issue secrets only through secure, server-controlled channels.  
- Monitor and log suspicious cross-account access attempts.
