# API Documentation Exposure â€” Lab: Discovering OpenAPI & Exploiting PATCH/DELETE

---

## ðŸ”¹ One-line summary
Found exposed OpenAPI docs (/openapi.json) â†’ discovered destructive PATCH/DELETE endpoints and reused an active session to perform a PATCH to /api/users/wiener (PoC attached).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
Public API documentation (Swagger / OpenAPI / Redoc) often reveals exact endpoints, HTTP methods, parameters and example payloads. When reachable in production, these docs greatly accelerate recon and let an attacker craft precise destructive requests without guessing field names.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology / Lab walkthrough (precise steps)
1. Open the lab and *log in* with:
   - username: wiener
   - password: peter

2. Navigate to *My account*.

3. In the account page: *update the email* field and click *Update*.

4. With Burp Proxy ON, capture the generated request:  
   PATCH /api/users/wiener HTTP/2 (request body contains modified email).

5. *Send the captured PATCH to Repeater*.

6. In Repeater, change the request path from:  
   PATCH /api/users/wiener HTTP/2  
   to:  
   PATCH /api HTTP/2  
   â€” then *Send*. (Observe HTTP 200 OK.)

7. Probe for API docs using the base path: check /api, /openapi.json, /swagger.json, /swagger-ui.  
   - *Found:* /openapi.json.

8. Inspect /openapi.json and identify destructive endpoints, e.g.:  
   DELETE /api/users/{username}

9. Return to the Repeater request, modify:
   - Method: PATCH â†’ DELETE
   - Path: /api/users/wiener â†’ /api/users/carlos
   - Ensure the captured session cookie is present.

10. *Send* the DELETE /api/users/carlos HTTP/2 request in Repeater.

11. Verify success (HTTP 200/204) and confirm the target user (carlos) is removed â€” lab solved.

## ðŸ”¹ Repeater-ready PoC (example)
DELETE /api/users/carlos HTTP/2 Host: <lab-host> Cookie: session=<SESSION> Accept: / Connection: close

---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Direct account modification / deletion â†’ data loss, account takeover.  
- Discovery of internal/admin endpoints â†’ SSRF, internal API abuse, larger compromise.  
- Easy automation of mass-extraction when docs enumerate many endpoints.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation (short)
- Restrict access to API docs in production (auth, IP allowlist, or VPN).  
- Remove sensitive examples / tokens and internal hostnames from docs.  
- Enforce server-side authorization for every endpoint.  
- Rate-limit and log access to docs and admin endpoints.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pentest checklist
- [x] Login & capture session cookie.  
- [x] Trigger UI actions to reveal API base path.  
- [x] Probe /openapi.json, /swagger.json, /swagger-ui.  
- [x] Inspect docs for destructive endpoints (DELETE, PATCH).  
- [x] Reuse session cookie and craft exact Repeater requests.  
- [x] Verify impact, save raw request/response and one screenshot as PoC.
