# Authentication Lab-1 â€” Username enumeration & Password brute-force

---

## ðŸ”¹ One-line summary
Identified username enumeration via subtle response differences, then used password brute-force against the discovered account to gain access (PoC attached).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
Authentication verifies identity (username/password/MFA). Username enumeration leaks whether an account exists and drastically lowers attacker effort. Once a valid username is known, automated password guessing (brute-force / credential-stuffing) can lead to account takeover and further escalation.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology / Lab walkthrough (concise flow)
- *Capture login flow* â€” with Burp Proxy ON, submit a normal login to capture POST /login (or equivalent).  
- *Manual enumeration check* â€” in Repeater, replace username with a candidate and use a known-wrong password; observe response differences (status, content-length, headers).  
- *Automated enumeration* â€” send the captured POST to Intruder with payloads on the username field (wordlist). Sort results by length/status to find the username that produces a different response (valid user).  
- *Password brute-force* â€” send the login POST to Intruder with payloads on the password field (username fixed to discovered user). Use Sniper or appropriate attack type; detect success by different status/length/redirect/Set-Cookie.  
- *Verify & document* â€” log in with the found credentials in the browser or Repeater, capture the successful response and screenshot the logged-in page. Save the raw request/response and screenshots as PoC.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Repeater / Intruder PoC templates
*Captured login POST (example)*
POST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: <LAB_HOST> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: session=<SESSION>

username=<CANDIDATE>&password=wrongpassword
*Intruder â€” username payload position*  
Place Â§usernameÂ§ at the username value and load wordlist of candidate usernames.

*Intruder â€” password payload position*  
Fix username to discovered account, place Â§passwordÂ§ at password value and load password list.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Proof (evidence)
1. *Username enumeration â€” differing response*  
   ![Username enumeration â€” different status/length indicates valid user](../images/auth-lab-username-enum.png)  
   (Screenshot: Intruder/Repeater results showing the username entry with a different status/content-length.)

2. *Password brute-force â€” discovered correct password*  
   ![Password brute-force â€” different response indicates correct password](../images/auth-lab-password-found.png)  
   (Screenshot: Intruder/Repeater hit showing the request/response that indicates a successful login attempt for the discovered username.)

3. *Lab solved â€” logged-in view / success page*  
   ![Lab solved â€” logged-in dashboard / admin panel showing successful login](../images/auth-lab-solved.png)  
   (Screenshot: browser showing the logged-in page or lab success confirmation.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Fast account discovery â†’ targeted attacks and credential stuffing.  
- Account takeover leads to data theft, abuse of user privileges, and potential vertical escalation (admin takeover).  
- Attackers can use valid accounts to bypass protections, access private features, or pivot.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation (short)
- Return uniform error messages & HTTP status codes for authentication failures.  
- Normalize response lengths and avoid side-channel leaks (timing, headers, redirects).  
- Rate-limit and throttle login attempts by IP and account; enforce progressive delays and account lockouts.  
- Enforce MFA for high-value accounts and strong password policies.  
- Monitor/alert on enumeration/brute-force patterns and apply CAPTCHAs when abusive activity is detected.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pentest checklist
- [x] Capture login requests and identify username param.  
- [x] Try manual enumeration in Repeater (wrong password).  
- [x] Automate enumeration with Intruder; sort by length/status.  
- [x] Brute-force password for confirmed username with Intruder (Sniper).  
- [x] Verify successful login, save raw request/response and screenshots.  
- [x] Recommend mitigation steps and re-test after fixes.

# Authentication Lab 2 â€” Username enumeration via subtle response differences 

---

## ðŸ”¹ One-line summary
Find a username that returns a subtly different response (status/length/whitespace), then brute-force that userâ€™s password and log in. (Exact method â€” copy/paste ready.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab demonstrates username enumeration using tiny response differences (content-length, whitespace, punctuation, headers or timing) and targeted password brute-force once a valid username is confirmed. Use Intruder with a Grep-Extract (Fetch Response) to reliably spot the subtle outlier.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology / Lab walkthrough 
1. *Capture a fresh login POST*  
   - Proxy ON, Intercept OFF. Submit the login form to capture POST /login.  
   - Right-click the captured request â†’ *Send to Intruder*.

2. *Set Intruder positions (username)*  
   - Positions â†’ Clear markers â†’ mark *only* the username field as payload: ...username=Â§usernameÂ§&password=...  
   - Edit the password value to a long string (200â€“400 a chars) to amplify timing/processing differences (optional).

3. *Prime responses (small probe)*  
   - Run 2â€“3 requests with different usernames to let Intruder collect sample responses (helps Fetch work).

4. *Add Grep-Extract (Fetch Response)*  
   - Options â†’ Grep - Extract â†’ Add â†’ choose Fetch Response.  
   - Highlight the exact standard error message in the preview (include punctuation/period/whitespace). Save extractor.

5. *Load full username list & run attack (Sniper)*  
   - Payloads â†’ load usernames.txt.  
   - Attack type = *Sniper* (or Pitchfork if doing parallel lists).  
   - Throttle: 300â€“500 ms. Timeout: 10â€“15 s. Follow redirects: *OFF*.  
   - Start attack.

6. *Identify candidate username(s)*  
   - Sort by *Extracted* column or look for rows where Extracted is empty (i.e., response didnâ€™t match the standard message).  
   - Inspect Raw response for the subtle difference (trailing space, missing period, slight length change). Copy the username.

7. *Password brute-force (for discovered username)*  
   - Capture a fresh login POST (to get fresh tokens), send to Intruder.  
   - Positions â†’ mark *password* only: username=found_user&password=Â§payloadÂ§.  
   - Payloads â†’ load passwords.txt. Attack type = *Sniper*.  
   - Same throttle/timeout settings. Start attack.

8. *Detect successful password*  
   - Watch for different *Status* (e.g., 302), different *Length*, or presence of Set-Cookie/Location header.  
   - Click the outlier row â†’ open Raw â†’ replay in Repeater or browser to verify login.

9. *Verify & capture PoC*  
   - Log in via browser or Repeater using found credentials. Capture screenshot of logged-in page / account (lab solved).  
   - Save the successful raw request + response + screenshots.

## ðŸ”¹ Repeater / Intruder templates 

*Baseline login POST (example)*
POST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: <LAB_HOST> Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: session=<SESSION>

username=wiener&password=peter

*Intruder username position (amplified password)*
username=Â§candidate_usernameÂ§&password=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

*Intruder password position (for found username)*
username=found_user&password=Â§password_payloadÂ§

---

## ðŸ”¹ What signals to use (priority)
1. Status change (200 â†’ 302 redirect).  
2. Content-Length difference.  
3. Presence of Set-Cookie or Location header.  
4. Slight whitespace/punctuation variation in response body.  
5. Response time (if timing is the only signal â€” use amplifier).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Proof (screenshots)
1. *Username discovered* â€” Intruder output row showing the discovered username with different Extracted/Length/Status.  
   ![Username found](../images/auth-lab2-username-found.png)

2. *Password found* â€” Intruder/Repeater showing the password guess that produced a success indicator (302/Set-Cookie).

---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Account takeover â†’ data theft, impersonation, further exploitation (IDOR, privilege escalation).  
- If admin or privileged user discovered â†’ full compromise.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation (short & report-ready)
- Return identical generic error messages for login failures (no username-specific content).  
- Return same HTTP status code for all authentication failures.  
- Implement rate-limiting and progressive delays per IP & per account.  
- Enforce MFA on privileged accounts.  
- Monitor and alert on enumeration/brute-force patterns.

---

# Authentication Lab-3 â€” Username enumeration via response timing (IP rotation) 

---

## ðŸ”¹ One-line summary
Enumerate a valid username using subtle response timing differences (amplified by long passwords), rotate IP via X-Forwarded-For to bypass IP lockout, then brute-force the discovered userâ€™s password and log in. (Exact steps â€” copy/paste ready.)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Overview
This lab uses timing differences (and optional IP rotation via X-Forwarded-For) to detect valid usernames that return subtly different server processing times. Once a username is confirmed, rotate source IPs when brute-forcing the password to avoid IP-based lockouts. Use Intruder (Pitchfork / Cluster Bomb) with amplified requests to reliably spot timing signals.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Methodology / Lab walkthrough (exact steps)

1. *Capture a fresh login POST*  
   - Proxy ON. Submit the login form once to capture POST /login.  
   - Right-click the captured request â†’ *Send to Repeater*.

2. *Confirm X-Forwarded-For support*  
   - In Repeater add header X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.55 â†’ *Send*.  
   - If lockout behavior changes, IP rotation is possible. If not, IP lockout may be per-account â€” proceed with caution.

3. *Send request to Intruder*  
   - Repeater â†’ *Send to Intruder*.

4. *Positions â€” prepare enumeration (Pitchfork)*  
   - Positions â†’ Clear markers.  
   - Add marker 1 on the last octet part of X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.Â§IPÂ§ (Payload set 1).  
   - Add marker 2 on username (Payload set 2).  
   - Set password to a long constant (â‰ˆ100â€“400 a chars) to amplify server processing time.

5. *Payloads for enumeration*  
   - Payload set 1 (IP octets): Numbers 1..N (or a small IP list).  
   - Payload set 2 (usernames): load candidate_usernames.txt.  
   - Attack type: *Pitchfork* (pairs IP[i] with USER[i]).  
   - Options: Throttle 300â€“500 ms, Timeout 10â€“15 s, Follow redirects OFF.

6. *Run & inspect timing*  
   - Start the attack. Enable timing columns (Response completed / Time).  
   - Sort by Response Time; look for a username with consistently higher response time (or unique response size).

7. *Confirm candidate*  
   - Click the candidate row â†’ Send to Repeater â†’ resend 2â€“3Ã— to confirm consistent timing or body difference.

8. *Prepare brute-force (Cluster Bomb â€” IP Ã— password)*  
   - Get a fresh POST /login into Repeater (fresh CSRF/session). â†’ Send to Intruder.  
   - Positions: add marker for X-Forwarded-For: Â§IPÂ§ (payload set 1) and marker on password=Â§PASSWORDÂ§ (payload set 2). Keep username=identified-user fixed.  
   - Payload set 1: list of IPs (ips.txt) or number range.  
   - Payload set 2: candidate_passwords.txt.  
   - Attack type: *Cluster Bomb*. Throttle 400â€“700 ms, Timeout 10â€“15 s. Run a small smoke test first.

9. *Detect success & verify*  
   - Watch for Status = 302, Set-Cookie, Location: /my-account or reduced Length.  
   - Click the hit â†’ open Raw â†’ replay in Repeater or browser.  
   - Verify login and capture the logged-in UI screenshot (lab solved). Save raw request/response.

## ðŸ”¹ Repeater / Intruder templates (paste & edit)

*Enumeration (Pitchfork â€” password amplifier)*

POST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: <LAB_HOST> X-Forwarded-For: 203.0.113.Â§IPÂ§ Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: session=<SESSION>

username=Â§USERNAMEÂ§&password=aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa

- Payload set 1 (IP): Numbers 1..N or ips.txt  
- Payload set 2 (USERNAME): candidate_usernames.txt  
- Attack type: Pitchfork

*Brute-force (Cluster Bomb â€” rotate IP Ã— password)*
POST /login HTTP/1.1 Host: <LAB_HOST> X-Forwarded-For: Â§IPÂ§ Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded Cookie: session=<SESSION>

username=identified-user&password=Â§PASSWORDÂ§

- Payload set 1 (IP): ips.txt  
- Payload set 2 (PASSWORD): candidate_passwords.txt  
- Attack type: Cluster Bomb

---

## ðŸ”¹ Troubleshooting & tips
- No timing signal â†’ increase password length (400â€“800 `a`s) and re-test a small subset.  
- Too many timeouts/errors â†’ increase throttle or reduce IP set.  
- CSRF/tokens rotate â†’ always start Intruder runs from a fresh Repeater capture.  
- If IP rotation not usable, consider lower-volume brute-force with long delays and monitoring.

## ðŸ”¹ Proof (screenshots)
1. *Username enumeration â€” timing outlier*  
   ![Username timing outlier found](../images/auth-timing-username-found.png)

2. *Password brute-force hit (rotated IP)*  
   ![Password brute-force success (rotated IP)](../images/auth-timing-password-found.png)

3. *Lab solved â€” logged-in target account*  
   ![Lab solved â€” lateral access / account page](../images/auth-timing-lab-solved.png)

---

## ðŸ”¹ Impact
- Account takeover; lateral access to user data and further escalation.  
- If repeated at scale, can lead to mass account compromise.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Remediation (short)
- Normalize login failure responses (no timing/behavior differences).  
- Reject/monitor suspicious ips / X-Forwarded-For header usage; validate proxy headers.  
- Implement per-account rate-limits and progressive delays; require MFA for sensitive accounts.  
- Log and alert on unusual IP rotation patterns.

---

## ðŸ”¹ Pentest checklist
- [ ] Confirm X-Forwarded-For behavior.  
- [ ] Run Pitchfork username enumeration (long password amplifier).  
- [ ] Confirm candidate username by replaying.  
- [ ] Run Cluster Bomb for password Ã— IP rotation (small smoke test first).  
- [ ] Verify login & capture PoC (raw request/response + screenshots).
